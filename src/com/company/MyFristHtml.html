                    Ooh<br />
                    Na-na, yeah<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh)<br />
                    You look so happy when I'm not with you<br />
                    But then you saw me, caught you by surprise<br />
                    A single teardrop falling from your eye<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    I don't know why I run away<br />
                    I'll make you cry when I run away<br /></p> 
                    <p> 
                    You could've asked me why I broke your heart<br />
                    You could've asked me why I broke your heart<br />
                    You could've told me that you fell apart<br />
                    But you walked past me like I wasn't there<br />
                    And just pretended like you didn't care<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    I don't know why I run away<br />
                    I'll make you cry when I run away<br /></p> 
                    <p>
                    Take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br />
                    Save your tears for another<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    Save your tears for another day<br />
                    Save your tears for another day (so)<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    I made you think that I would always stay<br />
                    I said some things that I should never say<br />
                    Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine<br />
                    And now you won't love me for a second time<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    I don't know why I run away, oh, girl<br />
                    Said, I make you cry when I run away<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br />
                    Save your tears for another<br />
                    I realize that I'm much too late<br />
                    And you deserve someone better<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    Save your tears for another day (oh, yeah)<br />
                    Save your tears for another day (yeah)<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    I don't know why I run away<br />
                    I'll make you cry when I run away<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah)<br />
                    I said, save your tears for another day (ah)<br /></p>
                    <p>
                    Save your tears for another day (ah)<br />
                    Save your tears for another day (ah)<br /></p>
